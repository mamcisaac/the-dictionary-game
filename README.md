# The Dictionary Game

A modern web-based word guessing game featuring an advanced difficulty-aware scoring system, accessibility features, and engaging user experience.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start** — Click "New Game" to see the word's first letter and one definition
2. **Guess** — Enter any word beginning with that letter and press Enter
3. **Get Clues** — Click "Get a Clue" to see available hint types with dynamic costs
4. **Win** — Guess correctly to earn points based on difficulty and efficiency!

## 🏆 Advanced Scoring System

### Difficulty-Aware Scoring
- Each word has a **difficulty score (0-1)** based on:
  - **Length**: Longer words = higher difficulty
  - **Frequency**: Rare words = higher base score  
  - **Complexity**: Limited definitions/examples = higher difficulty
- **Base scores**: 300-600 points depending on word difficulty

### Information-Theoretic Clue Costs
Clue costs are calculated using information theory principles:

| Clue Type | Typical Cost | Information Removed |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Additional Definition | ~10 pts | 0.8 bits |
| Word Length | ~13 pts | 1.1 bits |
| Example Sentence | ~18 pts | 1.5 bits |
| Synonyms/Antonyms | ~20 pts | 1.7 bits |
| Letter Reveal | ~56 pts | 4.7 bits (decreases) |

### Skill-Revealing Mechanics
- **First Guess Bonus**: +50 points for perfect insight
- **Progressive Penalties**: 
  - Guesses 1-5: Free
  - Guess 6+: -5 points each
- **Time Decay**: Gentle quadratic decay (0.001 × t²) capped at 200 points

### Normalized Final Scores
- All scores normalized to **0-1000 scale**
- Formula: `1000 × raw_score / 600`
- Perfect comparability across words and sessions
