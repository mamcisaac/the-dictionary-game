# Definition Quality Issues Report

## Summary
Analysis of 875 puzzle entries (5,351 definitions) revealed significant quality issues affecting 323 words (37%).

## Major Issues Found

### 1. Systematic Data Corruption (191 instances)

- Words starting with conjunctions (21 instances)
- Duplicate definitions (3 instances)
- Word concatenations (3 instances)

### 5. Typos Found
